      "{'raw': AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'reasoning_content': 'Okay, the user is asking, \"What is the best movie ever?\" That\\'s a pretty subjective question. People have different preferences, so what\\'s the best for one person might not be for another. But maybe they want a popular choice or a critically acclaimed film. Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check if there\\'s a function available to get movie details. The user provided a tool called Movie with parameters like title, director, year, genre, and rating. The required fields are title, director, year, genre, and rating. So if I can find a movie that\\'s often cited as the best, I can use this function to retrieve its details.\\n\\nBut wait, how do I determine which movie to pick? The user didn\\'t specify a particular genre or year, so I should go with a widely recognized top movie. Movies like \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" \"The Godfather,\" or \"Pulp Fiction\" are often mentioned in such debates. Let me check the ratings. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has a high IMDb rating, around 9.3. That\\'s a strong contender.\\n\\nI should use the Movie function to get the details of \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" Let me make sure I have all the required parameters. The title is \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" director is Frank Darabont, year is 1994, genre is Drama, and the rating is 9.3. That fits the required fields. \\n\\nBut maybe I should confirm if there\\'s another movie with a higher rating. For example, \"The Dark Knight\" has a 9.0, which is high but not as high as Shawshank. Or maybe \"Fight Club\" with 8.8. So Shawshank still leads. I think it\\'s safe to go with that. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the user wants a different perspective, maybe a classic like \"Citizen Kane,\" but its rating is around 8.4. So Shawshank is still higher. I\\'ll proceed with \"The Shawshank Redemption\" as the best movie ever based on the highest IMDb rating. \\n\\nSo the function call would be to Movie with the arguments: title \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" director Frank Darabont, year 1994, genre Drama, and rating 9.3. That should provide the user with the details they\\'re looking for.\\n', 'tool_calls': [{'id': 'wqsnyn05f', 'function': {'arguments': '{\"director\":\"Frank Darabont\",\"genre\":\"Drama\",\"rating\":9.3,\"title\":\"The Shawshank Redemption\",\"year\":1994}', 'name': 'Movie'}, 'type': 'function'}]}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 556, 'prompt_tokens': 249, 'total_tokens': 805, 'completion_time': 1.692412029, 'completion_tokens_details': {'reasoning_tokens': 496}, 'prompt_time': 0.010439413, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.157989636, 'total_time': 1.702851442}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_2bfcc54d36', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019bb5f7-b2cb-76b1-88b8-6f2ee7e695fd-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'Movie', 'args': {'director': 'Frank Darabont', 'genre': 'Drama', 'rating': 9.3, 'title': 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'year': 1994}, 'id': 'wqsnyn05f', 'type': 'tool_call'}], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 249, 'output_tokens': 556, 'total_tokens': 805, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 496}}), 'parsed': Movie(title='The Shawshank Redemption', director='Frank Darabont', year=1994, genre='Drama', rating=9.3), 'parsing_error': None}\n"
